# picR

Computation of predictive information criteria (PIC) from select model object classes for model selection in predictive contexts. In contrast to the more widely used Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), which are derived under the assumption that target(s) of prediction (i.e. validation data) are independently and identically distributed to the fitting data, the PIC are derived under less restrictive assumptions and thus generalize AIC to the more practically relevant case of training/validation data heterogeneity.

## Installation

You can install the development version of picR like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(picR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
