\usage{
PIC(object, newdata, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted model object.}

\item{newdata}{An optional dataframe to be used as validation data in computing PIC. If omitted, the training data contained within \strong{\code{object}} are used.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to other methods.}
}
\value{
The form of the value returned by \code{PIC} depends on the fitted model class and its method-specific arguments.
Details may be found in the documentation of each method.

\description{
\code{PIC} is the S3 generic function for computing predictive information criteria (PIC).
Depending on the \code{\link[base]{class}} of the fitted model supplied to \strong{\code{object}}, the function
invokes the appropriate method for computing PIC.
}
\details{
The PIC are model selection criteria that may be used to select from among predictive models in a candidate set.
The model with the minimum criterion value is preferred.

The PIC asymptotically select the candidate model that minimizes the mean squared error of prediction (MSEP),
thus behaving similarly to the the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). However in contrast to the AIC, the PIC
do not assume a panel of validation data that are independent and identically distributed to the set of training
data. This effectively enables the PIC to accommodate training/validation data \emph{heterogeneity}, where training
and validation data may differ from one another in distribution.

Data heterogeneity is arguably the more typical circumstance in practice, especially when one considers applications
where a set of covariates are used to model and predict some response. In these regression contexts, one often predicts
values of the response at combinations of covariate values not necessarily used in training the predictive model.
